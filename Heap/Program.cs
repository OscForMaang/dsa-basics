/*
 * Heap Tree: 
 *      A Binary tree with below properties: 
 *        1. Structure Property :
 *              All the levels have maximum number of nodes except possibly the last level, In the last level, all the nodes are to the left
 *              Complete Binary tree: H = CeilOf(log(n+1))
 *        2. Heap order Property :
 *              Key in any node N is greater than or equal to the keys in the both children of N
 *              Root node is the height key
 * In heap tree, there is no order maintain between sibling nodes 
 * Max Heap and Min heap
